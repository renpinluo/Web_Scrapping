<div> </div>
<div><ul><li><span><strong>Elevidys-treated boys aged 4-7 years with Duchenne showed an increase on the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), a measure of motor function, compared to placebo at 52 weeks but the primary endpoint was not met</strong></span></li><li><span><strong>For all key pre-specified secondary functional endpoints, time to rise and 10-metre walk test across age groups, clinically meaningful and statistically significant treatment benefits were observed</strong></span></li><li><span><strong>No new safety signals observed, reinforcing the favourable and manageable safety profile observed with Elevidys to date</strong></span></li><li><span><strong>Further evaluation of data is ongoing and Roche will discuss the path forward with health authorities</strong></span></li></ul> <p><span>Basel, 30 October 2023 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today topline results from the global, randomised, double-blind Phase 3 EMBARK study of Elevidys™ (delandistrogene moxeparvovec) in ambulatory boys (those who can walk) with Duchenne muscular dystrophy aged 4-7 years. In the study, Elevidys-treated patients improved 2.6 points on their NSAA total score 52 weeks after treatment, compared to 1.9 points in placebo-treated patients (0.65; n=125; P=0.24).</span></p> <p><span>In all pre-specified, timed functional key secondary endpoints, time to rise from floor and 10 metre walk test, clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements were observed. Both endpoints are prognostic factors for disease progression and loss of ability to walk. Additionally, a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement was also observed for the pre-specified secondary endpoint stride velocity 95th centile. This novel digital endpoint, qualified by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), measures speed of walking via a wearable device (Syde®). The time to ascend 4-steps secondary endpoint also demonstrated consistent treatment benefit in favour of Elevidys. </span></p> <p><span>All data are being further analysed and will be discussed with health authorities to determine the path forward. Detailed results from the EMBARK study will be shared at an upcoming scientific congress and a medical journal publication will be pursued.</span></p> <p><span>“High unmet need remains in Duchenne and we are encouraged by the consistent and meaningful results seen in all key secondary functional endpoints for Elevidys, an innovative gene therapy,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development, Roche. “We will work to further analyse the EMBARK results and consult with health authorities as quickly as possible. We sincerely thank all the boys, their families and the wider Duchenne community involved in this important research effort.”</span></p> <p><span>All key pre-specified functional secondary endpoints demonstrated robust evidence for a clinically meaningful treatment benefit that was consistent across age groups in Elevidys-treated patients compared to placebo at week 52.

Elevidys is a one-time treatment administered through a single (one-time) intravenous dose. Elevidys is contraindicated in patients with any deletion in exons 8 and/or 9 in the </span><span><em>DMD gene</em></span><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Elevidys received accelerated approval in the US in June 2023, in the United Arab Emirates in August 2023 and in Qatar in September 2023 for the treatment of ambulant children aged 4 through 5 years with Duchenne, who have a confirmed mutation in the </span><span><em>DMD</em></span><span> gene.</span></p> <p><span><strong>About Duchenne muscular dystrophy</strong></span><br/><span>Duchenne is a rare, genetic, muscle-wasting disease that progresses rapidly from early childhood. Approximately 1 in 3,500 - 5,000 boys worldwide are born with Duchenne, while Duchenne in girls is very rare. Everyone who has Duchenne will lose the ability to walk, upper limb, lung and cardiac function and mean life expectancy is 28 years. A diagnosis of DMD will require full-time caregiving which is most often provided by parents, the majority of whom will find it difficult to carry out usual work or household activities and suffer from depression and physical pain.</span></p> <p><span>Duchenne is caused by mutations of the </span><span><em>DMD gene</em></span><span>, which affects the production of the muscle protein, dystrophin. Dystrophin is a critical component of a protein complex that strengthens muscle fibers and protects them from injury during muscle contraction. Due to a genetic mutation in the </span><span><em>DMD gene</em></span><span>, people with Duchenne do not make functional dystrophin; their muscle cells are more sensitive to injury and muscle tissue is progressively replaced with scar tissue and fat.</span></p> <p><span><strong>About Roche in Neuroscience</strong></span><br/><span>Neuroscience is a major focus of research and development at Roche.
